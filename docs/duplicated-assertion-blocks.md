# Duplicated Assertion Blocks

This test file has several blocks of duplicated assertion statements. Avoid adding more.

Just like duplicated logic in application code is problematic, duplicated test criteria lead to code that's hard to maintain. Duplicated assertion blocks usually indicate a missing abstraction, either a supporting test function or a specific test is missing.
