Code Health Gate [beta]

**NOTE:** _This feature is experimental and subject to change._

The Code Health Gate compares all changed files with the current ```HEAD``` commit, and presents the files where any code health issue has been introduced.
The analysis is triggered on save and can also be run manually using the reload button.
